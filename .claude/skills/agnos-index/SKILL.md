# AGNOS Index (Claude Code entry point)

This is a thin pointer, kept in sync with the canonical procedure so the AGNOS process has a
single source of truth. Read and follow the full procedure (platform-aware script dispatch, exit
codes, index reading rules) at:

`.github/skills/agnos-index/SKILL.md`

Do not duplicate that procedure here; if it and this file ever disagree, the `.github` version is
authoritative.
